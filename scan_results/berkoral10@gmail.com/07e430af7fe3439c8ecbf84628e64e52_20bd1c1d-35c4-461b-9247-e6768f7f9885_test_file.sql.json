This limits the amount of data retrieved and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information.\n\nLine 2: The \"DROP TABLE accounts\" command is commented out to prevent accidental deletion of the 'accounts' table. This command should only be used when absolutely necessary and with proper authorization.\n\nLine 3: The \"OR 1=1\" condition is removed from the SQL query. This condition is always true and would return all customers, not just the one with id = 5. By removing it, we ensure that only the intended data is retrieved.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\n\nThe original code had serious security vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or loss of data. \n\nIn the first line, using \"SELECT *\" can expose all data in a table, including sensitive information. By specifying only the necessary columns, we limit the data that can be accessed, enhancing privacy and security.\n\nThe second line could delete an entire table from the database. This could result in a significant loss of data, which could disrupt business operations and lead to financial losses or legal issues.\n\nThe third line could return all customer data, not just the data for a specific customer. This could violate privacy regulations and expose sensitive customer information. By removing the \"OR 1=1\" condition, we ensure that only the intended data is retrieved, protecting customer privacy and complying with data protection regulations."}
