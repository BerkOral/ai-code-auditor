This is a unique identifier for the rule that triggered the message.\n- The \"fatal\" field remains false, indicating that this issue does not stop the program from running.\n- The \"severity\" field has been updated from 1 to 2. This indicates that the issue is of higher importance and should be addressed.\n- The \"message\" field has been slightly rephrased for clarity.\n- The \"nodeType\" field has been updated from null to \"File\". This indicates the type of the node that the message is related to.\n\n3. \ud83d\udd10 Why It Matters (real-world consequences in plain terms)\n- The fix matters because it improves the clarity and usefulness of the error message. By providing a unique ruleId, we can quickly identify and address the specific issue. \n- Increasing the severity level ensures that this issue gets the attention it requires. \n- Updating the nodeType from null to \"File\" helps us understand the context of the issue. \n- In plain English, this fix makes it easier for anyone reading the error message to understand what the problem is, why it's important, and how to fix it. This can save time and prevent potential security risks or program failures."}
