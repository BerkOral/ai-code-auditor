This limits the amount of data accessed and returned.\n\nLine 2: The \"DROP TABLE\" command has been removed entirely. This command deletes the entire 'accounts' table, which is a destructive operation and should not be used unless absolutely necessary.\n\nLine 3: The \"OR 1=1\" condition has been removed from the SQL query. This condition is always true and would return all customers, not just the one with 'id' equal to 5. By removing it, we ensure that only the intended customer's data is retrieved.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\n\nThe original code had serious security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access to data, data loss, or even complete deletion of data.\n\nIn the first line, using \"SELECT *\" can expose sensitive data if it's used carelessly. By specifying only the necessary columns, we limit the exposure of data.\n\nThe second line's command, \"DROP TABLE\", can lead to complete data loss. It's a command that should be used with extreme caution. In the wrong hands, it can lead to the deletion of important data.\n\nThe third line's \"OR 1=1\" condition is a common technique used in SQL Injection attacks. It can allow attackers to retrieve all data from a table, bypassing any conditions that were supposed to limit the data returned. By removing it, we prevent potential data leaks.\n\nIn summary, these fixes are crucial to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the data in your database."}
