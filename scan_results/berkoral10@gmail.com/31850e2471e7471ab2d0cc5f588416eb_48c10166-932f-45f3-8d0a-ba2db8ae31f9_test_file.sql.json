This limits the amount of data retrieved and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information.\n\n- Line 2: The `DROP TABLE` command has been removed entirely. This command deletes an entire table from the database, which is rarely necessary and can lead to significant data loss if used improperly.\n\n- Line 3: The condition `OR 1=1` has been removed from the SQL query. This condition is always true, which means the query would return all customers, not just the one with the id of 5. By removing this condition, we ensure the query only returns the intended customer.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\n\nThe original code had serious security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even complete data loss. By specifying only the necessary data in our queries, we reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information. Removing unnecessary and potentially harmful commands like `DROP TABLE` prevents accidental data loss. Finally, ensuring our queries only return the intended data prevents unauthorized users from accessing information they shouldn't have access to. These changes help protect the integrity and confidentiality of our data, which is crucial for maintaining trust with our users and complying with data protection regulations."}
