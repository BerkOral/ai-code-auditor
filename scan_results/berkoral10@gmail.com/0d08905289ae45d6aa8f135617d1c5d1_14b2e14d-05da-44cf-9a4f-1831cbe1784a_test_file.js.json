This helps in tracking and managing the rule.\n2. `\"fatal\": true,` - This line indicates that the rule violation is fatal. This means that if this rule is violated, the program should stop execution.\n3. `\"severity\": 2,` - This line assigns a severity level to the rule. The higher the number, the more severe the rule violation is considered.\n4. `\"message\": \"File ignored because outside of base path.\",` - This line provides a message that will be displayed when the rule is violated. It helps in understanding what went wrong.\n5. `\"nodeType\": \"file\"` - This line indicates the type of node that the rule applies to. In this case, it applies to a file.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\n\nThe corrected code is important because it provides more detailed and accurate information about the rule being applied. This helps in better management and tracking of the rule. The severity and fatal fields help in understanding the impact of the rule violation. This is crucial in deciding the course of action when the rule is violated. The nodeType field helps in understanding where the rule applies. This is important in identifying the source of the problem when the rule is violated. In simple terms, the corrected code makes it easier to manage and respond to rule violations, which can help in preventing potential issues and ensuring the smooth operation of the system."}
